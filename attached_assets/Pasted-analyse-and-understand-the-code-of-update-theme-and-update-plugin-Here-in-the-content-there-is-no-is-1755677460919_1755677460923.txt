 So first of all fix that version not updating problem

in path websites/15 here 15 is if of website in the update section we have available updates the correct thing is that we are getting here the old and the new version
That we're going to get but when I'm performing the Install or the download button then it is telling that the success but in reality it is not getting success
The problem is that Heres the old and the new version is same even after the updates it means it is fail
the activity I just performed and I get the response
